# NFSScript
A 'plug-in' for supported NFS games that allows scripting and further modding NFS games in .net.

# First of all
Please note that this project is in early alpha and a lot of functions, variables and documentation are missing, I am just one guy putting this all together by using my knowledge and the help of a very few others.
If you plan to write mods and/or contribute, you should check the [Getting Started](https://github.com/Venipa/NFSScript/wiki/Getting-Started) page. Any contributions to the project are welcomed! Use [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for that.

# Download
Downloads of this tool can be found on the [releases](https://github.com/Venipa/NFSScript/releases) page.
